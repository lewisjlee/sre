# Repo for SRE tool images
This repository manages SRE Tool images like EFK, ELK stack etc as well as Prometheus/Grafana.
It would cover not only slim images which is for test in personal VM but also formal images which can be used for real environments.
This repo is created to find out the configuration of each tool that can fit most for the environments and build images with it
